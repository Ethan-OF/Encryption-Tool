# EncryptionTool
Application should run on ALL windows 10 computers, other devices have not been tested. This is a simple app for encrypting or decrypting text without going through too much trouble. It can support a fair amount of text before a noticable lag. To change your key just click the 'New' button, to go back to the default, press the 'DefKey' button.

Usage of application is pretty much self explanatory.

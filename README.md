# Encryption Tool
Application should run on ALL windows 10 computers, other devices have not been tested. This is a simple app for encrypting or decrypting text without going through too much trouble. It can support a fair amount of text before a noticable lag. To change your key just click the 'New' button, to go back to the default, press the 'DefKey' button.

Usage of application is pretty much self explanatory.

**NEW**

This is a very old project I worked on, I wanted to hide texts between me and my friend in Microsoft Teams. I don't work on this anymore, but it reached a point where I am happy with the final product.

The key being visible in the code doesn't matter to me, as I never intended for it to be used by anyone other than myself. This will also be revamped later once school is finished forever. The program is slow in my standards, but it functions fast enough for what I wanted to do. Either way, I will be rewriting this in C++ later.

Everything to do with the code is a mess, I have scattered comments and ideas, it's not intended to be updated past this point, nor do I intend to clean up the code to a presentable standard, as I don't like altering old projects. As this was made years ago, there's no chance I will be touching it.
